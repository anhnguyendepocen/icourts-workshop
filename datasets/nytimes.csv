"Einstein and Freud on War> ""Is there a way to liberate man from the doom of war?"" wrote Albert Einstein to Sigmund Freud in 1932. Einstein's letter -- a working draft with many corrections -- and Freud's neatly penned, thoughtful response, covering 14 pages, are to be auctioned on Dec. 11 at Sotheby's in New York. Both men write of the human capacity to hate and destroy, expressing their convictions about the need for an international court to prevent war. Freud saw two possible ways to avoid war: through man's changing cultural disposition and the threat of terror. The letters, which were written at the request of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, were printed in 1933 in an edition of fewer than 200 copies, under the title ""Why War?"" Marsha Malinowski, one of Sotheby's manuscript specialists, said the letters were banned in Germany when they were printed, and never became widely known.","http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/30/arts/auctions.html",1990-11-30 00:00:00
"To the Editor: In this century, the world drifted into the senseless slaughter of World War I. That conflict started as a quarrel among imperial families. It ended with the meaningless deaths of 10 million, most of them young men in the trenches of Western Europe, under the shameful slogan of ""the war to end all wars."" The conflict that is looming today in the Middle East is just as senseless: a struggle to protect ""our"" oil, which happens to be under another country's land. To gain support for this inane policy, President Bush has miraculously become an advocate for the United Nations. The Reagan-Bush team spent the last 10 years disparaging the United Nations at every opportunity. This includes refusing to pay our country's assessed dues and the Administration's thumbing its nose at the United Nations International Court of Justice in ruling against United States mining of harbors in Nicaragua, intimating that United States policy is no business of the United Nations. Now, however, by the offer of loans, military aid or whatever, member states of the Security Council are persuaded to sanction the Administration's militant policy. This is a shameful misuse and corruption of the United Nations. The world organization must be used to settle disputes between nations; not as a means to sanction war for national interests. What the Security Council should be doing is sending in United Nations peacekeeping forces and establishing a negotiating team to find a reasonable settlement. What the American people should be doing is mounting a national protest; otherwise, another terrible and senseless war may be days away.

America and other countries committed to upholding international law against wholesale murder must do their utmost to see that he comes to trial. From 1975 to 1979 Pol Pot ordered more than a million people killed as he tried to bend Cambodia to his radical Maoist vision. People were executed because they owned property, because they lived in cities, because they were professionals. Even literacy became grounds for execution.

"Next month marks the ninth anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, to be followed in February by the ninth anniversary of the founding of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103. Finding strength through activism on antiterrorism and airline-security issues, this group of families of the 189 Americans who died became a role model for groups that emerged after the T.W.A. Flight 800 and Valujet 592 crashes and the Oklahoma City bombing. But the groups have also been vivid examples of how quests for truth can lead to frustration and infighting -- there are now four 103 outfits, and they don't always get along. ''The fights can be vicious,'' says a partisan. Leaders in all the camps say they want the same thing: justice. They just have wildly different opinions on how to achieve it. Here's a factional guide. Victims of Pan Am Flight 103: Still the largest group, claiming ties to 160 victim families, Victims supports Government efforts to punish Libya rather than challenging them as too soft, as other groups do. It rejects Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's recent effort to send the two Libyan suspects indicted by the United States Justice Department -- Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- to trial at the International Court at The Hague. The group's critics think it's too apolitical. ''Most are there for 'tea and grief,' '' says a member of a rival group. Jack Schultz, Victims' chairman (pictured with his son, who died in the crash), dismisses the carping. ''Some people are terribly upset,'' he says, ''because we haven't bombed Tripoli.'' Families of Pan Am 103, Lockerbie: Founded in 1989 by breakaway board members from Victims, this group claims 70 members. It supports a controversial multibillion-dollar wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the Government of Libya (and others) by more than 100 family members. Some rival victims groups call this a quest for ''blood money'' and charge that it could interfere with a successful criminal prosecution. But Families sees it as the only certain way to make Qaddafi pay. The group's most visible member is Victoria Cummock, whose on-camera presence at many disasters has earned her the nickname Grief Junky from critics. Justice for Pan Am 103: Founded in 1995 by Families group defectors who opposed the civil suit, this one claims only 25 members. It wants to reopen investigations into old theories that Iran and Syria were involved in the disaster. Terrorism Watch: Pan Am 103: Created in 1995 by Bert Ammerman (a former president of Families) and others, Terrorism Watch is hard line: it would like to see an American naval blockade of Libya and a trial at The Hague, the option Qaddafi favors. Other groups insist that the trial be held in the United States or Scotland. ''If you allow the indicted to choose their jurisdiction, that's like Terry Nichols' saying, 'I want to be tried in Canada with Congo law,' '' says Victoria Cummock. ''I understand Terrorism Watch's frustration, but you can't be so desperate.''","http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/magazine/sunday-november-23-1997-the-lockerbie-crash-all-not-together-now.html",1997-11-23 00:00:00

"The last time the world got a glimpse of Milan Kovacevic, he was guarding the portals of hell. He was a swaggering, beefy, profane man in a secondhand U.S. Marines shirt, and he was explaining to the television cameras why Serbs could never be secure until non-Serbs were removed from what he considered Serb territory. It was August 1992 in Prijedor, a city in northwest Bosnia and Herzegovina. A small group of reporters wanted permission to enter Omarska, a concentration camp not far from Prijedor. Omarska was the most notorious camp of the Bosnian war. Reports had already emerged that the guards there did not merely kill Muslim and Croat inmates but beat and tortured them to death with singular sadism and personal brutality. Kovacevic told the reporters they could visit Omarska but said that they would find ''not concentration camps but transit centers,'' and that what they were witnessing was ''a great moment in the history of the Serbian nation.'' Three years later, on a Radio Prijedor program commemorating that great moment, he boasted, ''I'm not afraid of any of those 21 cells in The Hague.'' There are actually 24 cells in the jail to hold the accused at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague. Since July of last year, one has been occupied by Milan Kovacevic. When he goes on trial on May 11, he will be the first man brought to justice at The Hague on charges of genocide, a crime considered the most heinous in human history, and one that is likely to carry the maximum penalty the tribunal can dispense, a life sentence. Kovacevic is depressed and suicidal according to a psychiatrist who interviewed him. He has developed heart problems and has had two, possibly three, strokes. When I saw him recently, in a courtroom at The Hague during a hearing on his case, it was hard to believe he was 56.

"To American eyes, the clerical dictatorships of Iran and Afghanistan can seem variations on the same Islamic fundamentalist theme. But relations between the two neighboring countries are now at a flash point. Ethnic, political and religious tensions have been exacerbated by the recent killings of at least eight Iranian diplomats by Afghan Taliban fighters. Iran is now assembling some 250,000 troops along the Afghan border and threatens military action unless its demands for amends are met. There is irony here, since nearly 20 years ago it was Iran that held 52 American diplomats hostage for 444 days. This time, Iran has a legitimate grievance. Carrying out its military threats, however, would undermine the efforts of President Mohammad Khatami to reassure the world that Iran no longer seeks to threaten its neighbors or export revolutionary violence. Instead Teheran should stick to diplomacy in pressing its demands for an apology and for prosecution of the killers by an Iranian or international court.","http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/17/opinion/iran-versus-afghanistan.html",1998-09-17 00:00:00

"Fifty years ago this week, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Genocide Convention. The world of 1948, impressed by the Nuremberg Tribunals, seemed ready to enforce international laws to prevent new acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. But nothing happened -- until 1993, when the international tribunal for Bosnia became the first of several new attempts to enforce these laws. One important reason for the change is the participation of citizen-activists, who have initiated some of the cases and played a major role in shaping the new courts. The case against Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile began with private citizens. An organization of Spanish lawyers filed a complaint accusing him of human rights abuses. The laws of Spain and many other nations allow judges to investigate complaints from the public and open a case if the evidence warrants. The 1994 French conviction of Paul Touvier for crimes against humanity in Nazi-occupied France also began as a complaint by the son of a victim, and the work of Nazi-hunters such as Beate Klarsfeld was instrumental in the 1987 conviction of Klaus Barbie. The only cases in American courts against foreign human rights violators are suits brought by private citizens against figures such as the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.","http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/12/opinion/citizen-activists-on-human-rights.html",1998-12-12 00:00:00

"The fugitive Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan has been handed over to Kenyan authorities by Greek Embassy officials in Nairobi, the Italian news agency ANSA reported today. ANSA said Mr. Ocalan, Turkey's most wanted man, had sought refuge at the Greek Embassy in the Kenyan capital. The agency said its report had been confirmed by Giuliano Pisapia, one of Mr. Ocalan's lawyers in Italy. No independent confirmation of the report was immediately available. Mr. Ocalan, sought by Turkey for leading a 15-year separatist campaign for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey in which 29,000 people have died, has been on the run since he left Italy on Jan. 16 after failing to gain asylum. [Mr. Pisapia and Mr. Ocalan's other Italian lawyer, Luigi Saraceni, appealed today to the Italian Government to ''undertake a vigorous diplomatic intervention to protect the security and save the life of Ocalan,'' Agence France-Presse reported. The lawyers said they feared that the Kenyan authorities might hand the rebel leader over to Turkey, which wants to try him on terrorism and murder charges.] Last month Italy, citing a law that prohibits the Government from extraditing anyone who could face the death penalty, turned down a Turkish request for Mr. Ocalan. His whereabouts have been the subject of much speculation since early February when he was refused entry into the Netherlands, where he reportedly wanted to appear before the International Court of Arbitration to plead the Kurdish cause. A Greek Government source said on Monday that Greek ambassadors had begun a diplomatic effort in European Union capitals to get the 15-nation bloc to address Mr. Ocalan's future at the highest level. Turkey has vowed to leave no stone unturned in its efforts to bring him to justice and he is viewed as a terrorist in a number of countries, including the United States. Greeks view him less harshly, seeing his struggle as similar to their own last century against the Ottoman Empire. But the Government has shown no desire to stir up trouble with Turkey, a longtime rival. In a statement sent to European media over the weekend, Mr. Ocalan said he had asked for political asylum from Italy, Russia and Greece. He also asked France and Germany to re-examine their position of opposition to his guerrilla group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party. A Greek Government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas, denied that Mr. Ocalan had asked formally for asylum and repeated Greece's position that he was not wanted. But he confirmed that Greece wanted a solution to Mr. Ocalan's predicament. Two Kurds were injured on Monday when one tried to set fire to himself during a protest in Athens over Greece's refusal to offer asylum to Mr. Ocalan. They were among about 60 Kurds protesting near the Greek Parliament to demand that Greece grant the asylum.","http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/16/world/greek-embassy-in-nairobi-hands-rebel-kurd-to-kenya-report-says.html",1999-02-16 00:00:00

"These days America finds itself at once uniquely strong and vulnerable, the only superpower and a target of envy, hostility and suspicion around much of the globe. The Bush administration has clearly been tempted to go it alone in this new environment, dodging any international undertakings that the United States does not completely control. President Bush has shown skill in working with Russia and other nations to put together a coalition to fight terrorism. But there are other critical problems in the world, some equally important to our own future and others of pressing concern to the people whose good will we need to fight terror abroad. They include global warming, proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons, fighting infectious diseases like AIDS and malaria and assuring the prosecution of war criminals. The United States does not rule the world, and the administration needs to think more creatively and strategically about how this country works with the rest of the planet.

"Slaughter, and then worse, came to Butare, a sleepy, sun-bleached Rwandan town, in the spring of 1994. Hutu death squads armed with machetes and nail-studded clubs had deployed throughout the countryside, killing, looting and burning. Roadblocks had been set up to cull fleeing Tutsis. By the third week of April, as the Rwanda genocide was reaching its peak intensity, tens of thousands of corpses were rotting in the streets of Kigali, the country's capital. Butare, a stronghold of Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus that had resisted the government's orders for genocide, was the next target. Its residents could hear gunfire from the hills in the west; at night they watched the firelight of torched nearby villages. Armed Hutus soon gathered on the edges of town, but Butare's panicked citizens defended its borders. Enraged by Butare's revolt, Rwanda's interim government dispatched Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, the national minister of family and women's affairs, from Kigali on a mission. Before becoming one of the most powerful women in Rwanda's government, Pauline -- as everyone, enemy and ally alike, called her -- had grown up on a small farming commune just outside Butare.

"In the first case of its kind since the Nuremberg trials, an international court here on Wednesday convicted three Rwandans of genocide for media reports that fostered the killing of about 800,000 Rwandans, mostly of the Tutsi minority, over several months in 1994. A three-judge panel said the three men had used a radio station and a newspaper published twice a month to mobilize Rwanda's Hutu majority against the Tutsi, who were massacred at churches, schools, hospitals and roadblocks. The court said the newspaper ''poisoned the minds'' of readers against the Tutsi, while the radio station openly called for their extermination, luring victims to killing grounds and broadcasting the names of people to be singled out.","http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/04/world/court-convicts-3-in-1994-genocide-across-rwanda.html",2003-12-04 00:00:00

Now, belatedly, it has taken an important and welcome step, with Wednesday's conviction by a special international court of three leading organizers of that slaughter. The three convicted men were not generals, militia commanders or politicians, but media executives. Hassan Ngeze owned a newspaper, Kangura, that, with deadly effect, urged its Hutu readers to murder Tutsis. Ferdinand Nahimana and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza ran a radio station, RTLM, that actually directed gangs of killers to specific Tutsi targets. Though words, not machetes, were their main weapons, they are at least as guilty as those who carried out their murderous instructions. Mr. Ngeze and Mr. Nahimana, who have already said they intend to appeal, were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Few would question Israel's right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks like the one yesterday, even to build a security wall if that were an appropriate means. It is also clear where such a wall would be built if security were the guiding concern: inside Israel, within the internationally recognized border, the Green Line established after the 1948-49 war.

"The resignation of Richard May, the chief judge in Slobodan Milosevic's trial, has added a serious complication to proceedings that, after two years and 300 witnesses, are a long way from finished. One of three judges at the special tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Judge May, of Britain, retired for health reasons just as the prosecution rested its case a full year later than expected. The delay was caused by the volume of the accusations, and Mr. Milosevic's defiant tactics and repeated illnesses. Even if the judge had not stepped down, Mr. Milosevic was expected to use his defense for maximum theatrics and propaganda. Now Mr. Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president, has grounds to demand an entirely new trial, or even a mistrial. How this plays out is critical, not only in the interest of bringing him to justice, but also for any future prosecution of dictators -- like Saddam Hussein -- by international courts.

Paul Bremer III, at the time the top United States administrator in Iraq, and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, then the commander of the American-led forces in Iraq; and four prominent Iraqis -- Mowaffak al-Rubaie, then a member of the Iraqi Governing Council and now Iraq's national security adviser; Adnan Pachachi, the foreign minister of Iraq before Hussein's reign; Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Shiite representative; and Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress.

The fence is being built in disputed territories that Israel won in a defensive war in 1967 from a Jordanian occupation that was never recognized by the international community. Israel and the Palestinians both claim ownership of this land. According to Security Council Resolution 242, this dispute is to be resolved by a negotiated peace that provides Israel with secure and recognized boundaries.","http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/13/opinion/why-israel-needs-a-fence.html",2004-07-13 00:00:00

The court's opinion marks a milestone in the Palestinian struggle. Yet its greatest impact may not be on Israel or its occupation of Palestinian territory. By calling on nations around the world to enforce international human rights law when enforcement is vetoed by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the court has essentially affirmed a power to ''veto the veto.'' The significance of this ruling cannot be overstated. The Security Council is generally considered the only United Nations body with the authority to enforce international law. Yet the council is often prevented from taking action by its permanent members, who can veto any council resolution. The result is that the United Nations is often impotent in the face of international crises.

A thick afternoon fog enveloped the trees and streetlights of The Hague, a placid city built along canals, a city of art galleries, clothing boutiques, Vermeers and Eschers. It is not for these old European boulevards, however, that The Hague figures in the minds of men and women in places as far apart as Uganda, Sarajevo and now Sudan. Rather, it symbolizes the possibility of some justice in the world, when the state has collapsed or turned into an instrument of terror. The Hague has long been home to the International Court of Justice (or World Court), a legal arm of the United Nations, which adjudicates disputes between states. During the Balkan wars, a tribunal was set up here for Yugoslavia; it has since brought cases against 161 individuals. It was trying Slobodan Milosevic -- the first genocide case brought against a former head of state -- until his unexpected death last month. And now the International Criminal Court has begun its investigations into the mass murders and crimes against humanity that have been committed, and are still taking place, in the Darfur region of Sudan.","http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/magazine/02darfur.html",2006-04-02 00:00:00

"8 P.M. (HBO2) WAR DON DON (2010) In the Krio language of Sierra Leone, ''War Don Don'' is the name of the civil war that raged from 1991 to 2001, during which the Revolutionary United Front fought to overthrow the ruling government. In 2003 the United Nations and the government of Sierra Leone spent more than $200 million to set up a Special Court -- the world's first international war crimes ''hybrid tribunal'' -- in an effort to seek justice and reconciliation. This documentary from Rebecca Richman Cohen, a Harvard Law School graduate who interned for a defense team at the court, follows the war crimes trial of Issa Hassan Sesay, above left, the highest-ranking survivor of the rebel group. It also explores both the limits of international justice and the contradictions in a man who dealt in blood diamonds, commanded child soldiers and oversaw mass atrocities against civilians -- but who is also credited by some with single-handedly ending the war. In 2009 Mr. Sesay was convicted of 16 of 18 charges and sentenced to 52 years in prison. The movie ''is less an investigation of guilt for war crimes than a contemplation of the viability of international courts,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. ''The film suggests that the hundreds of millions of American and British funds spent to build the court might better have been used to revive Sierra Leone's shattered economy.'' 8 P.M.

"LOWENFELD--Andreas. The family of Professor Andreas Lowenfeld announces with sadness that he died June 9, 2014 in New York, less than two months after the death of his beloved wife of 51 years, Elena. He was a dedicated, devoted and loving father and grandfather. Professor Lowenfeld was a towering figure in the fields of public international law, trade and economic law, private international law, and international arbitration. He served on the NYU Law faculty for 47 years, influencing generations of lawyers, and continued to teach International Litigation and Arbitration and International Monetary System among other courses until as recently as Spring 2013. Professor Lowenfeld wrote more than 18 books and authoritative legal treatises and over 115 law review articles and argued before the United States Supreme Court, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, and the International Court of Justice in the Hague. He made landmark contributions to legal scholarship and practice on issues as varied as extraterritorial jurisdiction, international arbitration, international monetary transactions, trans-border child abduction, international monetary law, investor-state dispute settlement, economic sanctions, enforcement of foreign judgments, aviation law, sovereign immunity, international trade, and civil procedure. His most recent work was a comprehensive treatise on International Economic Law. An avid supporter of the interaction between academics and practitioners, he was frequently an arbitrator in international disputes, public and private. He served as a Reporter on two major projects of the American Law Institute and was a lecturer twice at the Hague Academy, first in 1979 and later in 1994. In the 1994 lectures, he proposed criteria for a global community free of strict legal rules and based instead upon what he termed ""reasonableness, not certainty."" One of the hallmarks of his work was his commitment to eliminating what he viewed as an unnecessary divide between public and private international law. In 2007, he was awarded the Manley O. Hudson Medal of the American Society of International Law for his lifelong achievements in the field of international law. Born in Berlin, Germany in 1930 to a family of German-Jewish doctors, he came to the U.S. as a refugee from Nazism at the age of 8. After graduation with distinction from Horace Mann School, Harvard College and Harvard Law School in 1955, he served in the U.S. Army and then went on to practice law with Hyde and de Vries in New York. He then served for five-and-a-half years in the Legal Adviser's Office of the U.S. Department of State under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. He provided strategic counsel to those presidents during the Cuban Missile Crisis; the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; the so-called ""Chicken War,"" in which the U.S. and the European Common Market sparred over poultry tariffs; and the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic. He then served as a fellow for a year at the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University before joining the NYU Law faculty in 1967.

But there can be no argument about the binding effect of the judgment which the court rendered on May 24. n 1951, when Mossadegh - not the Shah - was the dominant political figure in Iran and brought about the nationalization of the oil industry, the International Court of Justice, on the application of Great Britain, issued an order for interim measures of protection. When Iran refused to comply, Great Britain appealed to the United Nations Security Council under Article 94 of the Charter. The Iranian representative, Allahyar Saleh, argued that an interim order was not binding but admitted that ''the final judgment'' of the Court is binding.","http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06E5DA1739F930A35755C0A966948260",1980-06-03 00:00:00

"By Hans Smit To the Editor: Now that the present Administration's efforts to resolve the Iranian hostage-taking appear to have led to their predictable results, it seems an appropriate time for reflection on the course next to be taken. At the beginning of the crisis, two approaches were possible. The United States could have insisted on Iran's complying with its clear treaty obligations and international law by demanding the surrender of the hostages and by refusing to make any financial concessions to Iran. Or the United States could have taken a more flexible position and have sought to negotiate.","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/04/opinion/l-a-blueprint-for-the-next-administration-s-position-on-iran-209018.html",1981-01-04 00:00:00
"Asked recently about the chances for an agreement at the conference here on South-West Africa, the nation to be known as Namibia, a South African Cabinet Minister replied that he was pessimistic. ''Do you think,'' he inquired, ''that it is possible to satisfy all the demands of Sam Nujoma?'' In fact, one of the striking features of the conference so far is that Mr. Nujoma, the leader of the insurgent movement known as the South-West Africa People's Organization, has made no demands whatsoever. In his one public statement, he simply declared - in a manner that his own spokesman, at least, could later call ''statesmanlike'' and that diplomats described as a refreshing change from his performance at previous meetings - that he was ready to sign a cease-fire now to end the guerrilla war on the disputed territory's northern border and start the transition to independence. So far the flow of demands and polemics has been almost entirely one-way, coming from political parties functioning inside the territory that have been seated here, against their own strenuous objections, as members of the official South African delegation. Some of these parties could marshal support in an election campaign but others have little more than a paper existence.","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/12/world/big-question-for-namibia-news-analysis.html",1981-01-12 00:00:00

But crucial portions of the agreements were kept a closely guarded secret today as unexpected problems developed in resolving Iran's disputes with large banks that hold most of the frozen assets. These problems centered on a secret 11-page appendix that, according to Behzad Nabavi, Iran's chief negotiator, was delivered to him today hours after the hostage accord had been signed.

"To the Editor: Following the rejoicing over the return of the hostages, there must come a sober assessment of the price paid. Throughout the crisis, the Carter Administration stressed that it would agree only to a settlement compatible with our national honor. The term ''honor'' is sufficiently vague to leave ample room for differences of judgment. Nevertheless, the national honor would appear compromised if the settlement departs from basic rules of fair, principled and constitutional conduct. Measured by that standard, the settlement reached appears not honorable in various respects.$ More recently, the Carter Administration asserted that the settlement merely undoes the measures taken in response to the seizure of the hostages. This assertion is inaccurate. Indeed, the settlement appears improper and substantially to reward Iran for its illegal conduct in at least three respects: * The United States gives up all claims, both its own and those of the hostages, arising from the seizure of the hostages and the embassy.","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/opinion/l-hostage-settlement-point-and-counterpoint-237674.html",1981-01-25 00:00:00
"Iran appeared so eager to resolve the hostage crisis last September that it alerted Washington ahead of time to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's statement outlining for the first time Iran's four conditions for releasing the hostages. In his most extensive discussion of the details that led to last week's agreement freeing the 52 Americans, the chief negotiator, Warren M. Christopher, disclosed that Iran sent an advance copy of the four points to insure that Washington would send a representative to a secret rendezvous in Bonn with Sadegh Tabatabai, the grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini. These other points emerged from the interview with Mr. Christopher and from talks with other officials: - The basic American negotiating position on resolving the hostage crisis was set in early September and did not change perceptibly throughout the negotiations. - Iran continually scaled down its financial demands to reach the accord. Initially it sought $14 billion in frozen assets; then it asked for $9.5 billion; then $8.1 billion, and finally it accepted $7.9 billion, of which less than $3 billion actually went to Iran. The rest was used to pay off American and foreign bank creditors.","http://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/28/us/how-hostage-pact-was-forged-turning-point-was-in-september.html",1981-01-28 00:00:00
"As the national celebration over the safe return of the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran draws to a close, the debate over whether to revoke or honor the complex agreements that led to their release may only be beginning. Some members of Congress, lawyers for many of the more than 350 companies and individuals that have sued Iran, and publications as diverse as The Wall Street Journal and The New Republic have asserted that President Reagan could and perhaps should renounce as extortionate and illegal all or part of the dollars-for-hostages deal negotiated with Iran by the Carter Administration through Algerian intermediaries. Several claimants have gone to court to challenge the constitutionality of efforts to transfer out of the country Iranian assets against which they have filed claims and to terminate their lawsuits in favor of the international arbitration provided in the agreements. Appeals From Carter Aides On the other hand, several former senior officials of the Carter Administration have urged their successors to scrupulously enforce the agreements, which they say are highly favorable to the United States and to Americans with commercial claims against Iran.

The reason for this helplessness is what many nations at the U.N. call an ''abuse of the veto power.''

"WASHINGTON DOES anything that deserves the name ''international law'' govern the use of military force? Last week's invasion of Grenada raised the question anew, as Reagan Administration lawyers and critics fenced with citations of treaties and charters, a familiar exchange in any shooting war. The Administration's shifting legal rationale for reconciling the invasion with nonintervention provisions of the United Nations and Organization of American States charters seemed barely plausible to many allies abroad and legal experts at home. House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., in expressing his fears of Administration policy, said the invasion was probably an illegal exercise in ''gunboat diplomacy.'' But not all legal experts saw it as bad policy. Such authorities as Don Wallace Jr., director of the International Law Institute at Georgetown University Law Center, said the episode showed the rules are inadequate. On occasion, he and others argued, good policy may require violating the rules or offering interpretations that bend treaty language. Washington cannot, they said, protect its interests as a great power and still comply with a literal reading of the United Nations Charter in the face of Soviet aggression and subversion, and internal repression by regimes of every stripe.

"WASHINGTON P OLITICAL moods in Washington often last, as a Scandinavian Ambassador put it, ''about as long as the flight of a chicken.'' Just three weeks ago the tide was running against President Reagan's Central American policy because Capitol Hill was in an uproar over the mining of Nicaraguan harbors. Last week, the tide turned. The harbor mining was barely mentioned in Congress and the President won a tight but important legislative vote authorizing more military aid to El Salvador. The shift reflected not only Washington's quixotic moods on Central America, but also the perpetual tug-of-war in the post-Vietnam era over any foreign policy that involves a conspicuous use of force. Congress had cooled off during its Easter recess as the headlines concentrated on President Reagan's trip to China. And the President, in a nationally televised appeal Wednesday night, made the dire prediction that ''the Communists will succeed'' in El Salvador unless Congress voted more aid. To Democrats, that sounded like an election-year warning that he would hold them harshly to account if the Salvadoran Government fell. In fact, officials said the President had toned down earlier speech drafts, which accused his critics of being as blind toward the Communist threat as some Europeans had been to Hitler in the 1930's. He dropped a defiant reference to the harbor mining after Senate Republican leaders said it would rekindle partisan passions.","http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/13/weekinreview/duarte-wins-a-crucial-one-for-reagan-in-salvador.html",1984-05-13 00:00:00

"If Ronald Reagan were a paid agent of the Soviets, he couldn't do any better for them than he is doing in Central America. He has managed to blur the distinction between the foreign policy goals of the United States in the Americas and those of the Soviet Union everywhere else. This is an achievement for which Leonid I. Brezhnev's successors should be truly grateful. The Reagan doctrine of 1985 is, continent for continent, virtually indistinguishable from the Brezhnev Doctrine of 1968. The essence of the Brezhnev Doctrine, according to so dispassionate a source as the ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' is that ''the U.S.S.R. and the community of Socialist nations had the right to intervene if, in their judgment, one of their number was pursuing policies that threaten the essential common interests of the others.''","http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/20/opinion/reagan-s-brezhnev-doctrine.html",1985-05-20 00:00:00

Rather than questions regarding the organization and the administering of resources, we face vested interests and new problems that undermine the necessary decisions to prevent, solve and move forward. The essence of the U.N.'s limitations is the lack of a genuine political will on the part of member states to fulfill and insure the fulfillment of the principles of the Charter, to subject their conduct to international law, to subordinate their selfish or immediate interests to the aims of a collective nature and to the higher purposes of our civilization.

In the past, the nation's law-enforcement officers remained mostly in the background on issues related to gun control.

This decision, involving Costa Rica, deserves close attention because it is the first time that any international court has considered the free press provisions of the Inter-American Declaration of Human Rights and because its ruling ought to have an important impact on 10 other Latin American countries with similar laws restricting journalists. The Costa Rica-based court, the Western Hemisphere's highest human rights tribunal, reviewed a Costa Rican law that prohibits anyone from becoming a journalist without a license.

"President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua left New York City yesterday, bound for Denver and an appearance at the convention of the National Bar Association, after six days of intensive diplomacy that found him pressing the Sandinista case and cause in settings as diverse as the United Nations and the Brooklyn waterfront. Officially, Mr. Ortega was in New York to urge the United Nations to support a decision by the International Court of Justice calling on the United States to stop ''arming and training'' anti-Sandinista rebels, known as contras. But he spent as much time here appealing directly to the court of American public opinion, bypassing an Administration in Washington that has dismissed him as ''a dictator in designer glasses.'' Those extraofficial efforts included such unconventional forays as a Sunday stroll along the promenade in Brooklyn Heights. There, after attending services at a Methodist church in Park Slope, he posed for photographers with the Statue of Liberty in the background as passing joggers looked on in astonishment.","http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/01/world/sandinista-heads-west-after-a-6-day-wooing-of-new-york.html",1986-08-01 00:00:00

Nominally, Mr. Ortega was in New York to urge the United Nations to support a June 27 decision by the International Court of Justice, the judicial arm of the United Nations, calling on Washington to ''stop arming and training'' the anti-Sandinista forces, known as contras. But he ended up spending most of his time in public settings designed to expose him to the American public and allow him to counter the image fostered by the Reagan Administration: that of a ''dictator in designer glasses'' who leads a ''terrorist regime'' in the same class as that of Libya's Muammar el-Qaddafi.","http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/03/weekinreview/the-world-ortega-has-learned-how-to-press-the-flesh.html",1986-08-03 00:00:00
