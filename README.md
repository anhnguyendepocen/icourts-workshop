## Description

This methodological workshop provides an introduction to automated text analysis using R. Throughout three different sessions, we will cover methods to conduct quantitative analyses of textual and web data, with an emphasis on social media data, applied to the study of International Courts and similar institutions.

The first session will cover the basics of programming in the statistical software R.

The second session will focus on the extraction and analysis of social media data using the statistical software R. It will provide an overview of the available tools to access data from the two most popular social media websites, Twitter and Facebook, and illustrate its potential for social science research with different examples of analyses that can be conducted with this data.

The third part of this workshop will show how to extract information from other web sources, such as online newspapers and other websites, using automated methods in R. This will be followed by a discussion of different methods to analyze large-scale text data, from the preprocessing stage to the analysis using machine learning methods, including supervised classification and topic modeling.

The participants will have the chance to run some of the exercises on their laptops with the use of the statistical software R (freely available). 

## Setup and Preparation

You will need to bring a laptop to all sessions of the workshop. You will need [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed. [Follow the instructions here to install both](https://github.com/pablobarbera/icourts-workshop/blob/master/installing_RStudio.pdf).

### Instructions for using course materials on GitHub ###

You have three options for downloading the course material found on this page:  

1.  You can download the materials by clicking on each link.  

2.  You can "clone" repository, using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop".  If you do not have a git client installed on your system, you will need to [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  This is preferred, since you can refresh your clone as new content gets pushed to the course repository.  (And new material will get actively pushed to the course repository while this course takes place.)

3.  Most simply, you can choose the button on the right marked "Download zip" which will download the entire repository as a zip file.

You can also subscribe to the repository if you have [a GitHub account](https://github.com), which will send you updates each time new changes are pushed to the repository.
