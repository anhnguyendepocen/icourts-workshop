Being designed for statistics and data analysis, `R` has powerful built-in functions for data manipulation. However, you can dramatically extend `R`'s functionality by writing your own functions.

### Making functions

`R` functions are objects just like the vectors and data frames we've worked with, so we create them using an assignment.

```{r}
times_2 <- function(x) x * 2
times_2(6)
times_2(1:5)
```

For longer functions, it's necessary to use curly braces `{}`. We can also input multiple objects into a function, and return more complex objects, such as a vector or list.

```{r}
two_numbers <- function(x, y) {
  my_sum <- x + y
  my_product <- x * y
  my_ratio <- x / y
  return(c(my_sum, my_product, my_ratio))
}
two_numbers(4, 11.93)
```

### Loops

"For" loops are probably the most common type of loop and are easily implemented in `R`. For instance, we can get the first 40 terms in the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.

```{r}
fib <- c(0, 1, rep(NA, 38)) # initialize fib sequence
for(i in 3:40) {
  fib[i] <- fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
}
```

### If statements

Depending on whether a condition is true or false, we might want to execute different chunks of code.

```{r}
compare_xy <- function(x, y) {
  if (x < y) {
    print("y is greater than x")
  } else if (x > y) {
    print("x is greater than y")
  } else {
    print("x and y are equal")
  }
}
compare_xy(3, 4)
compare_xy(4, 3)
compare_xy(1, 1)
```

### R packages

Lots of functions that aren't part of your base `R` installation have been included in external packages. For instance, some of the utilities we will use to download data from Facebook will require the `Rfacebook' package.


```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Rfacebook", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/") # installs
library(Rfacebook)
help("Rfacebook") # learn more about package
?Rfacebook
```

Most `R` packages are hosted on the CRAN repository, which is well maintained and does a good job minimizing package conflicts, but you can also install from other repositories, including GitHub.
