# Session 1: Introduction to R 
## March 30, 2016

Welcome to the workshop! 

The goal of this first lesson is to provide an introduction to R for non-programmers. I will provide an overview of the fundamentals of this programming language, how to open and work with data in R, and best practices when coding in R.

__Why R?__ 

- Currently used by most statisticians and social scientists interested in data analysis; and also becoming one of most [popular languages in Data Science](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html).
- Open source: makes it highly customizable and easily extensible through ["packages"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) (over 7,500 and counting!).
- Powerful tool to conduct automated text analysis, social network analysis, and data visualization, with packages such as quanteda, igraph or ggplot2.
- Command-line interface and scripts favors reproducibility.
- Excellent documentation and online help resources.

We will be using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to interact with R, and write our annotated R code using [Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
